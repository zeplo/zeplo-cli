# Zeplo CLI

[Zeplo](https://zeplo.io) is a managed message queue as a service. Blimey, that's a mouthful. We help you send queued messages without any setup. All you have to do is prefix your request with `zeplo.to/` and we'll queue it for you!

This is the CLI for Zeplo. It helps you to view requests, manage your account and has a really handy `dev` server.


### Install

Install using NPM:

```
npm install -g @zeplo/cli
```

Install using script:

```bash
curl -fsSL get.zeplo.io -o get-zeplo.sh
sh get-zeplo.sh
```

You should update Zeplo by running the same command.

### Dev Server (`zeplo dev`)

A local dev server that can be used during development. It implements the [same API](https://zeplo.io/docs) as the `zeplo.to`. By default it runs on http://localhost:4747 - you can specify an alternative port using `-p`.

To start a dev server use:

```
zeplo dev
```

And to queue a request use: 

```sh
curl http://localhost:4747/myurl.com?_delay=10
```

The `queue` and `requests` commands support a `--dev` flag which can be used to target your dev server instead of the Zeplo production servers. E.g. To list requests on your dev server use `zeplo requests --dev`

You can specify a workspace ID (and optional token) when creating the dev server, this allows you to start multiple servers without causing conflicts.

```sh
zeplo dev -w name:token123
```


#### Differences to production

There are some minor differences to the production server:

 * If token is not provided using `zeplo dev -w name:token`, then _token is not required. In production, _token param is always required.

 * Only the the following endpoints are supported. These endpoints work in the same way as the [Zeplo API](https://zeplo.io/docs), unless otherwise specified:

    * Queue [ANY] - `http://localhost:4747/<url>` (incl all headers/query parameters)
    * Bulk [POST] - `http://localhost:4747/bulk`
    * List requests [GET] - `http://localhost:4747/requests`. Only exact match filters are supported (e.g. `/requests?filters={duration: 0.1}`).
    * Get a single request [GET] - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>`
    * Pause request [PATCH] - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>/inactive`
    * Unpause request [PATCH] - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>/active`
    * Get request body [GET] - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>/request.body`
    * Get response body [GET] - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>/response.body`

* In addition, you can reset/remove *completed requests* by calling `/requests/reset` [POST]. If you wish to remove *ALL requests* (including pending and active requests), then append `?hard=1`. This can be useful for automated testing.
